<!-- a "div" is like a box where you can put content. These boxes can be moved around the web page, and you can stick lots of web elements in these boxes.
The "id" below refers to an "id tag" that styles this div in a specific way--you will find the styling in the .css file.-->

<!--the "a href" tag creates a link. In this case, I gave each project its own link so
that it will take you to that particular project on this page. See below where the "id"
of each project div is labeled "project1" or "project2" (etc.)-->
  <div>
    <ul> <!--"ul" means "unordered list. Each of the "li" (or "list items") will be marked with a bullet point.-->
      <h2>IDEAS 120 CLASS PROJECTS</h2>
      <li>PROJECT 1: <a href="#project1">Github Poetry</a></li>

    </ul>

<!--the "class" tag works a lot like the "id" tag, except it's helpful to use for a whole class
of divs - in this case, the "img_left" class will style all the images I want to align to the left
of the page.-->
